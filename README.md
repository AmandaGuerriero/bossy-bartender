# Bossy Bartender

![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Description
We were motivated because many people don't know how to make cocktails with the ingredients they have at home. Users are able to search for cocktails by ingredient, browse drinks, or just ask us to tell them what to drink! Account creation is available for users who want to save their favorite drinks for later. And, if they find a drink they love, they can text their friends about it. 

We developed the app using a few different libraries and is a fullstack website that uses sequelize to create databases and models.
